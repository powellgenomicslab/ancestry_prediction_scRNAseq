##### The following arguments are for indicating file locations on your system #####
####################################################################################
refs:
  genome: hg38 ## hg38 or hg19; genome the sequencing data have been aligned to
  fasta: /path/to/reference/fasta.fa ## Path to the reference fasta to be used for remapping for souporcell demultiplexing steps. Ideally this would be the same reference used for original mapping but any reference on the same genome with the same 'chr' encoding will do
  hg19_fasta: /path/to/hg19/reference/genome.fa ## Path to the reference hg19 fasta to be used for remapping for souporcell demultiplexing steps. Ideally this would be the same reference used for original mapping but any reference on the same genome with the same 'chr' encoding will do
  hg38_fasta: /path/to/hg38/reference/genome.fa ## ONLY NEEDED IF DATA ORIGINALLY MAPPED TO HG38; Path to the reference hg38 fasta to be used for remapping for souporcell demultiplexing steps. Ideally this would be the same reference used for original mapping but any reference on the same genome with the same 'chr' encoding will do
  vcf: /path/to/reference/vcf.vcf ## Path to a vcf for SNP genotype locations to use for souporcell. This is typically common SNP locations that can be from your own data or downloaded from 1000G or another resource. Should be filtered for high-confidence SNPs (filtered on INFO or R2) and high minor allele frequency (MAF > 0.01 or 0.05 depending on dataset size)

inputs:
  metadata_file: /path/to/samples_meta.tsv ## Sample metadata file that has two columns: 'Pool' and 'N'. The Pool should be the exact names of the parent folders for the scRNAseq output
  singularity_image: /path/to/singularity/image.sif ### The complete path to the singularity image that has all the softwares
  bind_path: /path ## List of paths to bind to Singularity. You can specify multiple directories by adding a "," between them. Eg. ${DIRECTORY1},${DIRECTORY2}. Singularity will bind the directory that you are running from + subfolders but will not be able to find anything above unless it is in this argument
  scRNAseq_dir: /path/to/scRNAseq/parent/directory ### the parent directory that has directories for each pool and the scRNA-seq output below it

outputs: 
  outdir: /path/to/parent/out/dir

snp:
  ref_snp_predict: False ## Set to true or false depending on if have reference SNP genotype data to be predicted for pipeline accuracy testing purposes
